# CS50_sql

This course is provided by Harvard University, one of their CS50 series. This course introduces SQL basics, including creating, storing, updating, and designing relational databases. Here I share the codes I used to solve the problem sets. The original problem sets can be found <a href=https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2023>here</a>. Please also follow the course's policy on **academic honesty** when using these codes.
